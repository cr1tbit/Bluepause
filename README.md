# Bluepause project

I'm trying to fall asleep. I'm listening to some leftist propaganda podcast or whatever and I decide I'm tired of human rights enough to fall asleep. 

The very operation of unlocking the phone and pausing the playback wakes me up again, so I now have to listen more and suddenly the birds outside start to sing.

## The button

This project is a firmware for bluetooth pause button.
